Cloud Application to circulate paper documents in soft copy form.

[Initial Seed project](https://github.com/nikhilnxvverma1/angular2-express-orientjs-seed)


This was a hackathon project for Nasa Space apps. The project is an attempt to clone google drive like UI to store files and folders so that they can be shared without the need to print them(hence ecocirculate).

This project was done in 24 hours, so code quality is okay at best. So far the backend seems to be working but it is still buggy. The frontend is incomplete.
